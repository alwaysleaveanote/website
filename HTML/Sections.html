	<h1> Sections </h1>
	<h2> Headlines </h2>
	<p> There are 6 headline options < h1 > through < h6 > which create headlines in different sizes. <br>
	They are separated by one line of white space. </p>

	<h2> Articles </h2>
	<p> the < article > tag is used to define sections of the page devoted to an "article" (blog post, newspaper, etc) <br>
	Articles have a more general < section > tag (with id attribute to give a name to the section you are defining) which <br>
	breaks the article up into more general sections (e.g page, chapter, etc).  Neither of these tags are in line. <br>
	There is a white line between each different section in an article. </p>
	<article>
    		<section id="intro">
       			<p>[An introduction]</p>
   		 </section>
   		 <section id="main_content">
        		<p>[Content]</p>
    		</section>
    		<section id="related">

        		</ul>
    		</section>

	<p> adding figures to an article is the same as adding the figure to your webpage, except you enclose it in the <br>
	< figure > (not inline) tag.  You can add a caption using the < figcaption > tag.  Adding hyperlinks is also the same <br>
	as adding links, except you enclose it in the < nav > (not inline) tag.  Both of these tags have id attributes because <br>
	they are considered sections of the article </p>
