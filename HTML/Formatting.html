			<h1> Formats </h1>
			<h2> Changing how words appear </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Italicizing: use <em> < em > and < /em > </em> tags. </li>
				<li> Bolding: Use <strong> < strong and < /strong > </strong> tags. </li>
				<li> Underlining: use <ins> < ins > and < /ins > </ins> tags. </li>
				<li> Striking: use <del> < del > and < /del > </del> tags. </li>
				<li> Highlighting: use <mark> < mark > and  < /mark ></mark> tags. </li>
				<li> Small Print: use <small> < small > and  < /small > </small> tags. </li>
				<li> Superscript: use <sup> < sup > and < /sup > </sup> tags. </li>
				<li> Subscript: use <sub> < sub > and < /sub > </sub> tags. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2> Creating new lines </h2>
			<p> < br > is used in line and moves you to the next line. <br>
			< p > and < /p > encloses a paragraph and seperates it from everything around it with an empty line </p>
			
			<h2> Headlines </h2>
			<p> There are 6 headline options < h1 > through < h6 > which create headlines in different sizes. <br>
			They are separated by one line of white space. </p>

			<h2> Abbreviations </h2>
			<p> "Abbreviating" a word makes it so that a small text box appears when you hover over the abberviated word <br>
			containing the full word.  You do this by using the < abbr > tag, with the attribute title = "FULL_WORD". <br>
			For example, < abbr title = "Hyper Text Markup Language > HTML < /abbr > creates <abbr title = "Hyper Text Markup Language"> HTML </abbr> </p>

			<h2> Quotations </h2>
			<p> HTML does not allow you to use quotation marks normally, so you must use special commands to create quotation marks. <br>
			There are 2 tags that accomplish this, the < blockquote > tag and the < q > tag. <br>
			< blockquote > is usually used for a multi line quotations and is not used in line. It indents the quote, and adds a <br>
			line above and below it.  < q > is usually used for short quotations and is used in line. <br>
			For example, Bob said <q>This is using a < q > tag </q><br>
			<blockquote>
				this is inside a blockquote!
			</blockquote>
			< blockquote > can also have a cite attribute to cite where the quote comes from.  There is also a < cite > tag, though <br>
			which italicizes the title of a work to show that you are citing it. <br>
			You don't use < em > to cite a work because when you, someone else, or a computer looks at the actual HTML file rather than <br>
			the website, it will get confused. </p>
			
			<h2> Showing code examples (but not running the code) </h2>
			<p> < code > is used to represent any form of computer code. Further, < var > can be used for <br>
			variables (which could be a variable in anything, not just in code - it could be a variable in an equation, for example), <br>
			< samp > for sample output, and < kbd > (keyboard) for user input.  For example: </p>

			<p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> (code and var) to the <code>destroy_planet</code> (code) 
			subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> (kbd) into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will 
			etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> (samp) on the planet's surface.</p>

			<p> NOTE: again, this only makes stuff looked italicized, but it makes the actual HTML file make more sense. </p>

			<h2> Addresses </h2> 
			<p> use the < address > tag.  For example </p>
			<em> Contact Details </em> <br>
			<address>
				<ul>
		    			<li>0123-456-7890</li>
		    			<li>author_dude@noplaceinteresting.com</li>
		    			<li>http://www.noplaceinteresting.com/contactme/</li>
				</ul>
			</address>

			<h2> Definitions </h2> 
			<p> does the same thing as the < abbr > tag, but gives a definition.  use the < dfn title = "definition" > tag.  For example: </p>
			Bob's <dfn title="Dog">canine</dfn> mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father sat him down and 
				carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of 
				chromosomes from different species">allopolyploid</dfn> organism.

			<h2> Bi-Directional Text </h2>
			<p> changes the direction the content is read.  Useful for displaying languages written right to left <br>
			uses the < bdo dir = "rtl_OR_ltr" >.  For example, < bdo dir = "rtl" > dog lmth< /bdo > makes <bdo dir="rtl">god lmth</bdo> </p>
		 
			<h3> Times </h3> 
			<p> Whenever you add a date or time to your page, you should add a < time > tag, so someone reading <br>
			reading your HTML file will know it is a time.  If you add a date/time to your page that is not in the <br>
			standard mm-ddd-yyyy or h:mm (on a 24 hour clock) form, then you should add a datetime attribute to the <br>
			< time > tag which is equal to the time you are depicting in standard, computer-readable form. <br>
			For example, I was born on <time datetime = "08-14-1994 18:00"> August 14, 1994 at 6:00 PM </time> (There's <br>
			a time tag on this, but it doesn't do anything to how the date appears) </p>
