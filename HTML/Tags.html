	<h1> Tags </h1> 
	<p> Tags are used to indicate what specific behaviors your web page should have and where. <br>
	Ordinarily, tags are of the form < tag > <em> content </em> < /tag >, which do a specific thing to their content <br>
	such as make it <em> italicized </em> or <strong> bold </strong>. <br>
	There are also empty or unpaired tags, which do not have any content or closing tag (< /tag >) and do a <br>
	specific task. (e.g < br > creates a line break). </p>
	
	<p> Tags can also have attributes, which are essentially just extra pieces of information about the element created <br>
	by the tag.  For example, if you create a new checkbox, it is usually unchecked, but you can add a checked attribute <br>
	to it so it starts out checked. </p>
	
	<h2> Meta Tags </h2> 
	<p> Meta tags are tags which don't actually change the look of the website, they just add extra information which is <br>
	used by browsers or things reading the actual HTML file. <br>
	one way the  < meta > tag is commonly used is to add information int the < head > part of your program (which doesn't appear <br>
	on the actual screen).  This specific < meta > usually uses the attributes name and charset. <br>
	name: usually "author", "description", or "keywords". The syntax is < meta name = "NAME" content = "whatever" > 
		<ul> 
			<li> author: Tells the browser who the author is. </li>
			<li> description: tells the browser a descritpion of the page.  Usually used in the description blurb
				under the title of the website. </li>
			<li> keywords: not used much anymore.  Used to tell the browser to show your website when xxx keywords
				are searched </li>
		</ul>
	 charset: used to define what the web page's character set is (text, html, etc). < meta charset = "utf-8" > defines <br>
		the page as using text/html.
