	<h1> Selectors </h1>
	<p> Where HTML has tags, CSS has selectors.  These determine the layout of particular sections of your page <br>
	You can give multiple elements the same style attribute by saying element1, element2, etc. { } </p>
	
	<h2> HTML Selector </h2>
	<p> HTML Selectors are a subclass of selectors which are simply the names of HTML tags and are used to change <br>
	the style of that tag. the inside of a selector is of the form property: value;.  For example: <br>	
	< body > <br>
	fontsize: 14px; <br>
	color: navy; <br>
	... <br>
	< /body > <br>
	gives the given value to the given property inside the body selector. </p>
	
	<h3> CSS Units </h3>
	<p> There are certain "units" which are used for many of values. <br>
	<ul>
		<li> px: unit for pixels (size is still changed when zoomed in or out) </li>
		<li> em: unit for calculated size of a font.  e.g 2em means words are twice the current size </li>
		<li> pt: unit for point.  Usually used in printed media. </li>
		<li> %: percent... </li>
		<li> Other units include pc (picas) and SI units. </li>  
		<li> 0: You don't need to include a unit on properties with a 0 value. </li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Class and ID Selectors </h2>
	<p> You can declare your own selector using class or ID selectors.  You declare style for these selectors <br>
	the same way you declare it for an HTML selector, except for ID selectors you use # infront of the name and <br>
	for class characters you use . infront of the name.  You start an ID section by opening a new div tag and giving <br>
	it an id attribute equal to the ID selectors name.  You declare a class by giving an ordinary HTML tag a class attribute <br>
	equal to the name of the class selectors name. <br>
	ids can be used to identify one element whereas classes can be used to identify more than one element.  e.g you can <br>
	only have one section named to a particular id, but you can have multiple elements named to a particular class. <br>
	You can also apply a selector to a particular HTML tag by using HTML_TAG.CLASS { }. </p>
	
	<p> You can also nest HTML, class, and id selectors by creating an id selector (the outermost "section" selector) <br>
	then creating a "id HTML/class { }" selector.  This makes everything with a certain HTML tag or class in the given <br>
	id section the style aspects </p>

	<h2> Pseudo Classes </h2>
	<p> Pseudo classes are bolted on to selectors to specify the style of something <em> with a specific state </em>.  <br>
	It takes the form of selector:pseudo_class { property:value; }.  <br>
	For example, if you want to make unvisited links blue and visited links purple, you would do a:link { color:blue } <br>
	and a.visited {color.purple }.  Other pseudo classes included active (something that is activated by the user, such <br>
	as a link is clicked), hover, and focus (when you are inside a text box for example). <br>
	NOTE: focus is not supported in all browsers, so don't use it for anything important. </p>
		
	<p> There is also the first-child pseudo class which effects whatever the first element of a section is </p>

	<h2> Pseudo Elements </h2>
	<p> Much like pseudo classes, pseudo elements are to specify the style of an imaginary sub-element of an element. <br>
	There are a number of often used pseudo elements </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> first-letter: the first letter of a heading/paragraph/etc. </li>
		<li> first-line: the first line of a heading/paragraph/etc. </li>
		<li> before/after: puts something before/after a given element </li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Positioning </h2> 
	<p> The position property is used to define whether a block is placed absolute, relative, static (normal), and <br>
	fixed (stays at that position on the page regardless of scrolling). </p>

	<h2> Universal, child, and adjacent selectors </h2>
	<h3> Universal </h3> 
	<p> using the * selector, you target everything.  This is commonly used to change things like margin. <br>
	The universal selector can also be nested. </p>

	<h3> Child </h3>
	<p> the > symbol between two selectors means that the second selector gets the defined attributes iff it is <br>
	a <em> direct </em> child of the first selector. </br>

	<h3> Adjacent </h3>
	<p> the + symbol between two selectors means that the second selector gets the defined attributes iff it directly <br>
	follows the first symbol in your HTML file. </p>
